# Biquadris

The code for this is temporarily available and will become private in some time.

# Dependencies: 
For the visual format need XMING installed and set up.

Otherwise playing via the command line is also an option.


Gameplay is very similar to Tetris, if you get a row filled with blocks then the row will disappear and the blocks on top will shift down. Whoever has the highest score by the time the block goes 'through the top' wins (use this to build your strategy). The generation of blocks are determined by a randomized seed, but as the levels get harder the blocks that come will be harder and harder to place.

# Play:
To run go into the folder biquadris-master and do ./biquadris

# Moves:
Movement is standard and as expected (ex. to move right simply type right and then hit enter). Move options include right, left, down, (up is not available but undo is available according to preferences), drop, clockwise (for clockwise rotation), counterclockwise (for counterclockwise rotation).

For easy typing, if differentiable, moves like counterclockwise can be done with coun, count, counte, ...
<p> </p>
As levels get harder the block moves down when you move right or left(sometimes 2 steps down depending on the level).

Note that to move n moves to the right, left, down, etc. you can place a number before your move like 5right. (Note that if you were to go beyond the edges of the wall, it will place you right at the boundary).
